# Sentiment Analysis with SageMaker - Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network (RNN/LSTM) performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project required some familiarity with SageMaker, because of that we needed to complete and undestand the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, provided enough background to understand the main SageMaker resources to complete this project.

This project is the first one of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program from Udacity.
